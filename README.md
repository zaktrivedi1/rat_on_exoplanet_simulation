## About

This was developed as a part of my third year General Physics project (during BSc(Hons) Physics course) to asses whether rat colonies, which are famously resilient and persistent, could survive on favourable exoplanets. It also provided some insight into the ability of these exoplanets to sustain any life.

## Features
- Creates rat class with biological parameters, such as age, weight, energy, temperature and gravity tolerance, as well as whether it was alive or not.
- Creates exoplanet classe with planet features and reads in exoplanet features from a csv file to create instances of these exoplanets.
- Simulates daily activity of the rats on each of these exoplantes using Monte Carlos methods subject to various death probabilites that depend on both exoplanet and rat features.
- Tracks the evolution of population over time with a time step of 1 day.
